  ON A FINE SATURDAY DR.DAVIS HAD RECIVED A EMAIL FROM GOOGLE. HE DIDNT KNOW IF IT WAS REAL OR NOT SO HE SEARCHED IT UP. 
  HE SAW THAT PEOPLE CAN SEND AN EMAIL SAYING ITS GOOGLE AND STEAL ALL YOUR PASSWORDS. DR.DAVIS DECIDED THAT IT WAS BEST IF
  HE DELETED THE EMAIL AND NEVER OOK BACK. SO THATS WHAT HE DID.
